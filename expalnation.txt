         When designing a microservices architecture, each service should be designed to handle a specific business 
         capability. Here, I'll provide a brief description and some example attributes for each of the services
         you mentioned: user-service, 
                        bus-service, 
                        bus-booking-service, 
                        payment-service.

User Service:
-------------

Attributes:
userId: Unique identifier for each user.
firstName and lastName: User's name.
email: User's email address.
password: User's hashed password.
address: User's address.
phoneNumber: User's contact number.
createdAt: Timestamp indicating when the user account was created.
updatedAt: Timestamp indicating when the user account was last updated.

Responsibilities:
Manage user information.
Handle user authentication and authorization.

Bus Service:
---------------

Attributes:
busId: Unique identifier for each bus.
busNumber: Identification number of the bus.
capacity: Maximum number of passengers the bus can accommodate.
model: Bus model or type.
operator: Bus operating company or owner.
route: The route the bus follows.
departureTime and arrivalTime: Timing details of the bus schedule.
Responsibilities:
Manage information related to available buses.
Provide details about bus schedules and routes.

Bus Booking Service:
---------------------

Attributes:
bookingId: Unique identifier for each booking.
userId: Reference to the user making the booking.
busId: Reference to the bus being booked.
seatNumber: The seat number booked by the user.
bookingTime: Timestamp indicating when the booking was made.
status: Current status of the booking (e.g., confirmed, canceled).
Responsibilities:
Handle the process of booking a bus by a user.
Manage and track the status of bus bookings.

Payment Service:
--------------------

Attributes:
paymentId: Unique identifier for each payment.
bookingId: Reference to the booking associated with the payment.
userId: Reference to the user making the payment.
amount: The amount paid for the booking.
paymentTime: Timestamp indicating when the payment was made.
paymentStatus: Current status of the payment (e.g., success, pending).
Responsibilities:
Handle payment transactions for bus bookings.
Ensure the security and integrity of payment processes.

            These are just examples, and the actual attributes and responsibilities may vary based on your specific requirements.
            Additionally, each service should have well-defined APIs for communication, 
            and you might use technologies like RESTful APIs, gRPC, or message queues for inter-service communication in a microservices architecture.
