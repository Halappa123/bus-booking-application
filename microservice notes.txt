             MICROSERVICE- also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application 
                              as a collection of services that are:
                             Independently deployable
                             Loosely coupled
                             Organized around business capabilities
                             Owned by a small team
                            The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, 
                            complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - 
                            a necessity for competing and winning in todayâ€™s world.
